=========

This repository contains the code of Viralflow, a workflow to performs a reference guided genome assembly of non-segmented viruses written in Nextflow. The workflow was developed to work with Illumina paired-end reads. Tests with other technologies should be performed.

## Documentation

The official documentation could be accessed `here <https://viralflow.github.io/index-en.html>`_ in English or `here <https://viralflow.github.io/>`_ in Portuguese.

ViralFlow is a nextflow pipeline and should be treated as such, check `vfnext/` for more detail. 
A wrapper for the pipeline is provided for user convenience.
